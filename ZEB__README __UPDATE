I worked on 

Single Page View for both Artist and Genre
they are finished except the images 
i spent 2 hours getting the image scale to work but i couldnt so i will work on it tommorow 
i also had to change the genre api sql statement because it was wrong- i dont know how randy didnt check that lol 

i still need to clean up code (like random echo array statements) - so ignore those 
THERE is also some code redundancy -- i will clean that up!
Also i used my assignment 1 css to show the Single Page View for both Artist and Genre 


what  i still need to do: (or Anyone can do it - if you know how to)

- do the single painting view for a single painting with the color scheme
- Sessions 
- login / log out user information to be verified and put into db
- favorites 
///// i posted  a link on the group chat about login and sign up form. its a step by step tutorial. only thing its missing the salt value 


- of course css

YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO CHANGE ANY CSS FILE OR REFERENCE - i used mine just so i can see stuff!
AT this point DO whatever you can. IF you know how to do something DO it !!! 
comment otherperson code -- and work on what you want!


ALSO if you guys have problem doing CSS - 
create a new file with different name!
copy the code to the new file and see if it works

CLOUD 9 is a pain !!! So thats the only solution i found so far 

if this doesnt work!!

Create a new work place 
download the files from our current work place 
and upload them to your new work place 

IF nothing works !!! TAKE A BREAK! lol pray to GOD so your code works!

DONT GIVE UP! YOU GOT THIS!! lol
