Home page has 3 sections 
1. Gallery list

2. All Artist List

3. All Genre 


*For each sections we will have a seperate .php file 
Why? because it is easier to implement while we all wrok collaboratively.
Also it will make it easier to design(CSS) without inteferring anyones else work

Once we get it working, we will copy the entire php script from each file and paste it in the index.php file.
And add click event handler to hide/show each php script

For the implement of each list, we can copy code from one of our own assignment 1.

we will need to have implement genre list as it wasnt in the previous assignment
